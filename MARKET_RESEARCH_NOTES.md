# SubSwipe Market Notes (Working Draft)

## Why short-form feed products win
- Low-friction start: content appears immediately.
- Habit loop: swipe, novelty, fast reward.
- Strong personalization over time.
- Clear creator/community identity.

## What users expect (baseline from Reels/Shorts/TikTok behavior)
1. Instant first content (<2s perceived)
2. Clean full-screen media with minimal chrome
3. Sound controls that are obvious and fast
4. Smooth next-item transition with no blank frames
5. Lightweight discovery (autocomplete, presets, trending)

## SubSwipe differentiation angle
- "Community-first reels" based on subreddit discovery.
- Better curation controls than mainstream short-form apps.
- Open-source + transparent roadmap.

## Priority roadmap (next)
- Infinite paginated feed with prefetch of next chunk.
- Session-level ranking (boost watched/completed items).
- Save/favorite channels and recent search history.
- Media quality selector: Auto / Saver / HD.
- Fast-fail handling for dead media URLs.

## GTM (free channels)
- GitHub + discussions + issues as feedback inbox.
- Reddit showcase posts (where rules allow).
- IndieHackers build-in-public logs.
- X launch thread + weekly feature clips.

## Success metrics
- D1 return rate
- Avg reels viewed/session
- Feed load success rate
- Time to first content
- % sessions enabling sound
