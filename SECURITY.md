# Security Policy

## Supported versions
SubSwipe currently supports the latest `main` deployment.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security findings.

Instead:
1. Email the maintainer privately.
2. Include reproduction steps and impact.
3. Allow reasonable remediation time before disclosure.

## Scope notes
- SubSwipe is a client-side app and does not store user credentials.
- Avoid introducing dependencies with known high/critical vulnerabilities.
